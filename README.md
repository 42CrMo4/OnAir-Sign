# OnAir-Sign
433MHz operated On Air sign for a music studio or a Radio Station to signal that music production is in porgress. 
This project consits of two Arduinos (Pro Mini, Nano or similar), LED Strips and the communication Modul HC-12. 

## Materials
* Arduino Nano 2x (alternativ Pro Mini or similar)
* Cherry MX switches 4x
* HC-12 Module 2x 
* LEDs (all LEDs supported by the [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) Library are possible)
  * Strip WS2812b 
  * Circle PCB WS2812b
* Capacitor 2x 22 ÂµF to 1 mF
* Micro USB breakout board (2x) (for reference something like (that)[https://www.ebay.com/itm/5Pcs-Micro-USB-Board-Power-Adapter-5V-Breakout-Switch-Interface-Module-F-Arduino/153733325920?hash=item23cb386460:g:TX4AAOSwbb5d1qM8] of ebay)
